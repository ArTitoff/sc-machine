# **sc-machine Runner**

!!! note
    This is correct for only versions of sc-machine that >= 0.10.0.

Sc-machine is a sc-memory with opportunity to add modules consistent with the general sc-machine interface. All such modules are named extensions, must be shared libraries (with file extension `.so` or `.dylib`) and stored in common directory (by default it is `./build/<Release|Debug>/lib/extensions`). By default, sc-machine contains sc-server that allows to communicate with sc-memory through network. You can find `sc-machine` in a `/build/<Release|Debug>/bin` directory.

```sh
Usage:
  ./build/<Release|Debug>/bin/sc-machine [options]

Required options:
  --storage|-s <directory>                Provide a path to directory with knowledge base binaries. Knowledge base binaries should be generated by sc-builder binary.
                                          This path can also be provided via the `storage` option in the [sc-memory] group of the configuration file specified with --config|-c.
                                          If both options are provided, the value from --storage|-s takes precedence.
  --config|-c <config-name>.ini           Provide a path to configuration file. If `storage` option is not provided as argument, then this file should contain `storage` option in `[sc-memory]` group.
                                          Configuration file can be used to set additional (optional) options for ./build/<Release|Debug>/bin/sc-machine.

Options:
  --extensions|-e <directory>             Provide a path to directories containing extensions. Extensions should represent compiled dynamic libraries of agent sc-modules.
                                          This path can also be provided via the `extensions` option in the [sc-memory] group of the configuration file specified with --config|-c.
                                          If both options are provided, the value from --extensions|-e takes precedence.
  --clear                                 Run sc-memory in the mode when it overwrites existing knowledge base binaries.
  --verbose|-v                            Shutdown sc-memory without dumping its state into knowledge base binaries.
  --test|-t                               Test sc-memory state. If this flag is specified, sc-memory will be initialized and shutdown immediately.
  --version                               Display version of ./build/<Release|Debug>/bin/sc-machine.
  --help                                  Display this help message.

Environment variables:
  SC_SERVER_HOST                          Specifies a host for sc-server extension. If not set, the value defaults to the `host` option in the `[sc-server]` group of the configuration file.
                                          If neither is specified, the default host is 127.0.0.1.
  SC_SERVER_PORT                          Specifies a port for sc-server extension. If not set, the value defaults to the `port` option in the `[sc-server]` group of the configuration file.
                                          If neither is specified, the default port is 8090.
```

Example of usage:

```sh
cd sc-machine
./build/<Release|Debug>/bin/sc-machine -c ./sc-machine.ini
```
